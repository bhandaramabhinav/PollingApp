            <h6>built with foundation</h6>
            <p>There’s nothing small about the effects on this “Mini” website and its use of scrolling as a fly-around of its eponymous car. The parallax steps aside on mobile for a neat intuitive image layout. The hamburger menu spins into action when clicked revealing a gorgeous dropdown.</p>

            <p>It’s hard to fault GoPro for their efforts to make their site, partnered with Marriott, friendly towards mobile devices. But it’s the active photography that makes us want to go.
